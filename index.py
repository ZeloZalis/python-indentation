# The way you import:
import sys, os
from datetime import date

# Class and functions are writed like this:
Class FileChecker():
  # There is two ways for functions:
  def pdf_check(self):
    pass

  def docCheck(self):
    pass

# For variables and constants
one_variable = (x*7)
CONSTANT = 'https://github.com/ZeloZalis'

# This is the correct way to use whitespace:
if x == 4: print(x, y); x, y = y, x
spam(ham[1], {eggs: 2})
i = i + 1
submitted += 1
x = x*2 - 1
hypot2 = x*x + y*y
c = (a+b) * (a-b)
